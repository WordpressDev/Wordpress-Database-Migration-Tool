Moving a Wordpress site to a new host or changing its domain
can be a huge PITA, because WP itself as well as many plugins 
store the filesystem location of the WP install as well as URL's 
for WP site in the database.

This tool updates Wordpress MySQL databases when moving
a Wordpress site to a new filesystem location, or when 
changing the URL for a Wordpress site.

Basically updates wp_options and wp_posts references to 
these values.  Takes care to not break serialized PHP arrays.

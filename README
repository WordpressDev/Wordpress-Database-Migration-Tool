Description:

Moving a Wordpress site to a new host or changing its domain can 
be a huge PITA.  This is because WP itself (as well as many plugins)
store the filesystem location and current URL of the Wordpress site 
in the database.  So, simply copying your files and database may
unexpectedly break things.

Given the old and new URL's or filesystem paths, this tool updates a 
Wordpress MySQL database (it just updates wp_options and wp_posts -
seems to be the only places this is stored). 

Most importantly, it takes care to _not_ break serialized PHP arrays,
as many plugins now store their information in this manner.  Just doing
a SQL string REPLACE() call - as was the old way to do this - will 
"break" serialized PHP arrays in almost all cases.

Use:

Run it through Apache (recommended) by copying this folder to an Apache 
server that has access to your Wordpress MySQL database.  
Running ./install.sh should fix up permissions for most folks if needed.

You may also run it from the command line:
    php move-wordpress-cli.php

which may be preferable for large databases.

You may want to increase the 'max_execution_time = x' value in your php.ini 
if it seems to be timing out.

Enjoy
